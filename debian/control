Description: PayPal API
 Business::PayPal::API supports both certificate authentication and
 the new 3-token "Signature" authentication.
 .
 It also support PayPal's development sandbox for testing. See the
 sandbox parameter to new() below for details.
 .
 Business::PayPal::API can import other API derived classes:
 .
 use Business::PayPal::API qw( RefundTransaction );
 .
 This allows for much more concise and intuitive usage. For example,
 these two statements are equivalent:
 .
 use Business::PayPal::API::RefundTransaction;
 my $pp = new Business::PayPal::API::RefundTransaction( ... );
 $pp->RefundTransaction( ... );
 .
